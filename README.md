Courseworks for F27ID

This course was an introduction to UI/UX design. In this course, we designed a UI for an E-Medical app that helps to connect old people with their doctors, without having to leave their home. We created personas and made changes to the design based on the feedback received from the course instructor. The UI has been designed using the Justinmind application.
